The application supports multiple metric hacking models, including DISTS, LPIPS, and HaarPSI, available in different sizes
to suit a range of devices and performance capabilities.
Currently all the models are CPU-only.

The application uses parallel processing of multiple frames to improve the performance,
ensuring that users can enjoy smooth, real-time style transfer effects.
Also it features an intuitive interface, allowing users to quickly and easily navigate and use all the features.
